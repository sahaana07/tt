        <p><font size="17"> Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. 
            It is a gas giant, with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth.
             It has an eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.
             Even though Saturn is almost as big as Jupiter, Saturn has less than a third the mass of Jupiter. 
             Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km), with an orbital period of 29.45 years.
             Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and an outer layer of gas. 
             Saturn has a pale yellow hue, due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. 
             An electrical current in the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's,
              but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth because of Saturn's greater size.
